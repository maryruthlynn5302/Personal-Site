    My mom, Julie, was the school's Barnyard Teacher where she took care of a small livestock animals and taught small children the agricultural ups and downs. All with good fun of course. My father worked at Los Angeles Pierce College, a community college with lots of majors and minors but my dad also worked in a agricultural field.
    He earned his Bachelor's Degree in Dairy Science from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I grew up an AG Kid and loved every second of it. I loved it so much that I continued my agricultural studies in high school where I joined 
   The National FFA Organization. Living
